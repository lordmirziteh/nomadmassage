		  <h2>About My Service</h2>
          <p>Nomad Massage is a professional, premium massage service delivered, in-home, by an insured and licensed Massage Therapist.</p>
		  <p>I, Shelby Mirziteh, am a male therapist with over seven years of massage experience. After working in spas for the majority of my practice, I decided to start my own massage therapy service to meet the needs of clients in a more personable, local, and stress-free way. </p>
		  <p>My massage style is sure to satisfy almost any client by offering a balance of relaxing and therapeutic touch, with varying pressure from feather-light to incredibly-deep. My method focuses on client-stated issues first with medical massage techniques and using my signature flowing style to ease the body into a state that is receptive to healing and relaxing. </p>
		  <p>This massage service can be scheduled ahead or used on-demand.This takes even the slight stress that comes with traveling to and from your spa or clinic; when your massage is finished, you're already right where you want to be. The flexibility of my model means that you no longer have to go through clinic and spa receptionists who's job it is to sell services, memberships, and products you didn't want or need. My motives are to give you the massage that you want, focus on the help you need, and to make an honest living. </p>
		  <p>There are other on-demand massage services similar to mine. What sets my service apart from them is that you will never have to welcome random therapists of varying skill levels into your home based on who's available at the time. While I am but one man and do not have the kind of availability these services offer, you are always communicating directly with me. After your first massage, I'm simply your Seattle neighbor who is YOUR massage therapist and we work together to accomplish your massage goals. Not to mention I can charge little less!</p>
		  <p>While I do not offer a multitude of special healing modalities that some therapist may offer, I focus on giving the very best Swedish and Deep Tissue massages possible. In my entire career as a therapist, I have never received a bad review or negative feedback; my massage technique stands on it's own. </p>
		  <p>If you need pregnancy massage (post second trimester), cupping, sports stretching, reflexology, reiki, acupressure, lymphatic, or other treatments that I do not offer, I can gladly refer you to other therapists that I trust.</p>
