      <h1 class="w3-center">About Nomad Massage</h1><br>
	  
      <h4 class="w3-center">What is Nomad Massage?</h4>
      <p class="w3-large">Nomad Massage is a professional massage service delivered to your home by an insured and Licensed Massage Therapist.</p>
	  
	  <h4 class="w3-center">Who is the Therapist?</h4>
      <p class="w3-large"> I am a male therapist with over seven years of massage experience. After working in spas for the majority of my practice, I decided to start my own service to meet the needs of clients in a more personable, local, and stress-free way.  </p>
	  
	  <h4 class="w3-center">What is the Massage Like?</h4>
	  <p class="w3-large">My massage style is sure to satisfy mosts clients by offering a balance of relaxing and therapeutic touch. My pressure ranges from feather-light to super-deep tissue.<br/>My method focuses on immediate client-stated issues first, using medical massage techniques and my signature flowing style to ease the body into a state that is receptive to healing and relaxing. I understand and respect that it is your time, your money, and your massage; I want to cater to your specific massage needs.</p>
	  
	  <h4 class="w3-center">How does the service work?</h4>
	  <p class="w3-large">This massage service can be scheduled ahead or used on-demand (when available). This takes even the slight stress that comes with traveling to and from your spa or clinic; when your massage is finished, you're already right where you want to be. The flexibility of my model means that you no longer have to go through clinic and spa receptionists who's job it is to sell services, memberships, and products you didn't want or need. My motives are to give you the massage that you want, focus on the help you need, and to make an honest living.  </p>
	  <p>*I am currently in college full-time, so this limits my availablity for on-demand service. However, if you contact me about an on-demand massage and I'm not available, I can usually schedule for the next day or two</p>

	  
	  <h4 class="w3-center">How does this service compare to others like it?</h4>
	  <p class="w3-large">There are other massage services similar to mine. What sets my service apart is that you will never have to welcome random therapists of varying skill levels into your home based on who's available at the time. While I am but one man and do not have the kind of availability these services offer, you are always communicating directly with me. After your first massage, I'm simply your Seattle neighbor who is YOUR massage therapist and we work together to accomplish your massage goals. Not to mention, I can charge little less!</p>
	  
	  <h4 class="w3-center">Is there anything else I should know?</h4>
	  <p class="w3-large">While I do not offer a multitude of special healing modalities that some therapist may offer, I focus on giving the very best Swedish and Deep Tissue massages possible. In my entire career as a therapist, I have never received negative feedback or a bad review; my personal massage technique stands on it's own.  <br/> If you need pregnancy massage (post second trimester), cupping, sports stretching, reflexology, reiki, acupressure, lymphatic, or other treatments that I do not offer, I can gladly refer you to other therapists that I trust.</p>
